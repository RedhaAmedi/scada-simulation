# SCADA Oil & Gas Simulation

A beginner-friendly project exploring the basics of SCADA systems using **Siemens SIMATIC WinCC**. Built as a personal learning journey to understand how industrial systems -such as those in the oil and gas sector—are monitored and controlled.

## 🌍 Overview

This project simulates a simplified oil & gas monitoring environment. It uses visual elements like pipelines, pressure/temperature gauges, and alarms to mimic what operators might see in a real SCADA control room.

Though it's not connected to real equipment, the focus was on grasping the core ideas: data acquisition, HMI design, and alert handling.

## 🎯 Purpose

As someone interested in industrial automation and control systems, I wanted to get hands-on experience with SCADA software and understand how it can be used to:

- Monitor process variables (like pressure, flow, and temperature)
- Set up alarms for safety conditions
- Visualize trends over time
- Simulate user interactions with HMI elements

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal)** – for HMI/SCADA design
- **S7-1200 PLC (simulated)** – no physical hardware required
- **Basic scripting/tag setup** – for alarms and logic

## 🧩 Features

- HMI screen layout with simulated pipeline flow
- Alarm system when readings go out of range
- Real-time data simulation using internal tags
- Trend view for historical data (temperature, pressure)
- Basic user interface with start/stop control buttons
